          We are excited to host virtual workshops and webinars tailored to the academic, private sector, and corporate sectors. These workshops have been crafted by Dr. Jones, to be interactive, engaging, and thought-provoking. Workshops are also designed for Dr. Jones to travel to your city, and your institution to build community. Please contact us for more details. We will post more detail as we enter the middle part of July 2021.
