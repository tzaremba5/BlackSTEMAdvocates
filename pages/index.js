Every since meeting Derick, there has always been a feeling of someone having my back. Many times, I did not have to speak and Derick would say | I feel you and everything will work out. I have seen Derick's passion uplift people in the darkest times. Derick is what love is on earth. We are so fortunate to share space with them in this universe.  Derick has challenged me as a politician to think about the people we often forget about. I can always count on Derick to give me the truth!"
